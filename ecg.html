										<h2>Project Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
										 to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into two 
										 categories: Sinus Rhythm and Atrial Fibrillation. 
										 The model is trained, validated, and tested a noisy ECG data,
										 The project successfully developed a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
										  for classifying ECG signals into Sinus Rhythm and Atrial Fibrillation. 
										  With optimized preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and an
										   effective architecture, the model achieved
										    a high test accuracy of 96.1% and demonstrated strong generalization
										</p>The dataset utilized in this case study 
										PTB-XL Atrial Fibrillation Detection Dataset (2000), 
										is a comprehensive collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) 
										data designed for time-series analysis. The dataset comprises two 
										components: an information dataframe and a 3D array of ECG signals.

										The ECG data includes approximately 6,428 unique ECG strips, 
										representing distinct patients. Each strip is sampled at 150 Hz over a duration
										 of 10 seconds, resulting in around 5,000 integer samples per patient. 
										 Altogether, this equates to a dataset of over 32 
										 million rows of time-series data. The information dataframe provides 
										 metadata and classification labels for each ECG strip, 
										 categorizing the signals into normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 
										 and other arrhythmias

												<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
											</header>
											<p>To prepare the dataset for analysis, a series of preprocessing steps
												were performed to optimize its structure and reduce its dimensionality
												 while preserving relevant information for atrial fibrillation detection. 
												 Unnecessary columns were removed from the information dataframe, retaining only 
												 those related to rhythm labels and ECG signal quality. The ECG signal data, initially a
												  3D array containing the number of ECG recordings, total samples per recording, and 12 
												  standard ECG leads, was reshaped into a 2D array. This restructuring enabled
												   compatibility with algorithms requiring 2D inputs. <p> 
												   <p> Given the dataset's substantial size (32,140,000 rows),
														data reduction techniques were applied. The number of samples per
														 ECG was reduced from 5,000 to 2,000, focusing on the rhythm rather than axis 
														 orientation, which is less critical for atrial fibrillation diagnosis.
														  Additionally, the number of leads analyzed was reduced from 12 to 4, 
														  further optimizing the dataset. The reshaped ECG data was then merged
														   with the information dataframe, resulting in a consolidated dataset with
															columns for rhythm labels, case IDs, and ECG quality indicators. <p> 
												   <p> Further dimensionality reduction involved filtering out noise and 
													   irrelevant cases. Columns indicating noise types (e.g., baseline 
													   drift, electrode issues, or artefacts) were examined, and cases
														with pacemakers were excluded. Pacemakers replace irregular
														 atrial fibrillation rhythms with regular paced rhythms, which
														  could confound the learning process.

												<h3>Key Model Components</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed using the Keras 
											Sequential API to classify ECG signals into two categories: Sinus Rhythm 
											and Atrial Fibrillation. The architecture includes multiple convolutional 
											layers with filters of increasing size (32, 64, 128), kernel size of 5, and 
											ReLU activation to extract meaningful features from the time-series ECG data.
											 Each convolutional layer is followed by Batch Normalization and MaxPooling 
											 layers (pool size: 1x8) to stabilize learning and reduce dimensionality.
											The Flatten layer prepares the features for a dense output layer with a
											 softmax activation to output probabilities for the two classes. The model
											  employs the Nadam optimizer with an initial learning rate and an exponential 
											  decay schedule to fine-tune the learning process over epochs. A categorical
											   crossentropy loss function is used for classification. To enhance training 
											   efficiency and prevent overfitting, the model includes Early Stopping
											    (monitoring validation accuracy) and a Learning Rate Scheduler to
												 adapt the learning rate dynamically.

												<h3>Hyperparamater tuning
												</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hyperparameter tuning focused on optimizing the CNN architecture for
												 classifying ECG signals. The process involved adjusting key parameters, 
												 including the number of filters per convolutional layer (32, 64, 128), 
												 initial learning rate (0.10), and learning rate decay factor (tested at 3).
												  The Nadam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function were used to
												   ensure efficient training for the multi-class classification task. 
												   The tuning process iterated through decay rates, training the model 
												   with early stopping and a learning rate scheduler to balance convergence
												    speed and stability. Performance metrics, including maximum training and
													 validation accuracies, were recorded for each configuration. The best
													  model demonstrated robust accuracy, reflecting effective hyperparameter
													   selection for detecting atrial fibrillation. </p>

													The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved excellent performance in classifying ECG signals into Sinus Rhythm and Atrial Fibrillation. On the unseen test dataset, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 96.1% with a test loss of 0.1299, indicating solid predictive capabilities. The classification report highlighted high precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes, with:


														Sinus Rhythm: Precision = 98%, Recall = 94%, F1-score = 96%
													Atrial Fibrillation: Precision = 95%, Recall = 98%, F1-score = 96%

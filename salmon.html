						                This project explores predictive modeling techniques for identifying disease outbreaks in farmed salmon within Norway,
						                focusing on time series methods. It contrasts the effectiveness of traditional SARIMAX models with Temporal Convolutional
						                Networks (TCNs), emphasizing the integration of exogenous variables and the complexities of capturing non-linear patterns
						                in disease outbreak data. The project reveals the limitations of SARIMAX for modeling complex, multi-dimensional time
						                series data in the context of disease outbreaks among salmon. Temporal Convolutional Networks emerged as a more effective
						                approach, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness in handling non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies.
						                An interactive map was created in Python using Folium. Sea temperature and all the outbreaks over time for each site are displayed.
						                If the site has a deeper red it means there are more active outbreaks at that site. Clicking on the site provides information on lice count per fish,
						                sea temperature, and the number of licensed sites in that area to give an idea of density.

						                        The primary datasets were retrieved from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (2024). The API allows selection of
						                        the two main datasets proposed in this study: Salmon diseases and Salmon lice. The datasets are recorded from 2012 to 2019,
						                        with approximately 75,000 disease events and the salmon lice dataset has approximately 750,000 rows.
						                        The second dataset tracks weekly records of salmon lice infestation levels and environmental conditions across various salmon farms in Norway.
						                    </p>
						                    <p>
						                        This project involved integrating multiple datasets in different formats to create a comprehensive framework for predicting disease outbreaks in farmed salmon.
						                        Geospatial data (e.g., GeoJSON) was combined with CSV outbreak records, structured environmental databases, and Excel files containing farm-specific metrics.
						                    </p>
						                    <p>
						                        A key challenge was harmonizing these diverse formats and aligning them temporally, as the data were collected at varying frequencies
						                        (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Temporal resampling and interpolation were used to create a unified timeline, while geospatial data
						                        were transformed into tabular formats to integrate with time series models.
						                    </p>
						                    <p>
						                        The variability in scales and units across datasets required robust scaling and normalization techniques.
						                        Missing data were addressed using imputation methods, while dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) helped manage the high dimensionality introduced by numerous exogenous variables.
						                        This integrated dataset enabled inclusion of critical factors like temperature, lice counts, and farm density into both SARIMAX and TCN models.

						                        The investigation analyzes each county separately to align with the disease management priorities of the kommune, focusing on localized outbreak patterns.
						                        The following results are from Trøndelag. Seasonal decomposition plots revealed both clear seasonal patterns and long-term trends,
						                        justifying the use of models that explicitly capture seasonality, such as SARIMA and SARIMAX.
						                        To develop the SARIMAX models, optimal hyperparameters (p,d,q) and seasonal terms (P,D,Q,s) were determined via grid search.
						                        Separate models were fitted with and without exogenous variables to assess their contribution.

						                        The exogenous variables — sea temperature and total lice counts — were normalized using MinMaxScaler.
						                        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to address multicollinearity, with the first principal component (explaining 90%+ of the variance)
						                        used as an alternative input in one SARIMAX model.

						                    <p>
						                        A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) was also trained to forecast normalized disease outbreaks using sea temperature and lice count as exogenous features.
						                        Input sequences were created with a lookback window of 150 time steps. The model architecture included a TCN layer with 64 filters,
						                        kernel size of 5, and dilations of [2, 4, 8], followed by a dense output layer. The model was trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer.

						                    <p>
						                        Hyperparameter optimization was done via grid search over filters, kernel sizes, dilation sets, learning rates, and batch sizes.
						                        For each config, a TCN model was trained for 30 epochs using a validation split. Validation and test MSEs were recorded.

						                    <p>
						                        Despite including exogenous predictors such as sea temperature and total lice counts, SARIMAX did not improve forecast accuracy over SARIMA.
						                        Forecasts and errors were nearly identical, indicating the exogenous variables did not add meaningful predictive power.

						                    <p>
						                        This suggests that the seasonal structure alone captured by the SARIMA model is the dominant signal in the data.
						                        PCA-transformed features added to SARIMAX also showed no measurable performance impact.

						                    <p>
						                        The TCN model outperformed all others in terms of mean squared error (MSE), indicating better capture of temporal patterns using exogenous variables.
						                        However, imperfections in predictions suggest other underlying trends are still unexplained by temperature and lice counts alone.

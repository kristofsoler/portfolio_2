										<h2>Overview</h2>

									<p>This project explores predictive modeling techniques for 
										identifying disease outbreaks in farmed salmon within Norway,

										  of traditional SARIMAX models with Temporal Convolutional Networks
										   (TCNs), emphasizing the integration of exogenous variables and
										    the complexities of capturing non-linear patterns in disease 
											outbreak data.The project reveals the limitations of SARIMAX for modeling complex,
											 multi-dimensional time series data in the context of disease outbreaks
											  among salmon. Temporal Convolutional Networks emerged as a more
											   effective approach, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness
											    in handling non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies.</p>

												<h3>Project Task</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The primary datasets were retrieved from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority
												 (Norwegian Food Safety Authority, 2024). The API allows selection of
												  the 2 main datasets proposed in this study: Salmon diseases, Salmon lice.
												   The datasets are recorded from 2012 to 2019 with approximately 75000
												    disease events and the salmon lice dataset has approximately 750000 rows.
													 2nd dataset (salmon Lice) tracks weekly records of salmon lice infestation
													  levels and environmental conditions across various salmon farms in Norway.
													   This project involved integrating multiple datasets in different formats
													    to create a comprehensive framework for predicting disease outbreaks
														 in farmed salmon. Additionally, geospatial data in formats like 
														 GEOjson The data sources ranged from outbreak records in CSV 
														 files to environmental metrics stored in structured databases
														  and farm-specific metrics in Excel files.<p>
														  
														  <p> A key challenge
														   was harmonizing these diverse formats and aligning them temporally,
														    as the data were collected at varying frequencies (e.g., daily
															, weekly, and monthly). Temporal resampling and interpolation
															 were employed to create a unified timeline, while geospatial
															  data were transformed into tabular formats to integrate with
															   time series models. The variability in scales and units across
															    datasets required robust scaling and normalization techniques to
																 ensure consistency. Missing data were addressed using imputation
																  methods, while dimensionality reduction helped manage the high
																   dimensionality introduced by numerous exogenous variables.
																    The resulting integrated dataset enabled the inclusion of
																	 critical factors like temperature, lice counts, and farm 
																	 density into the modelling process, using both SARIMAX and TCN models.
																	  This comprehensive data preparation facilitated a deeper exploration of
																	   temporal and spatial patterns, ultimately improving the predictive accuracy 
																	   of disease outbreak models and providing a goodfoundation for
																	    model comparison and evaluation.</p>

												<h3>Key Model Components</h3>
											</header>
											<p> This study evaluates the effectiveness of the SARIMAX model in integrating exogenous variables
												 for disease prediction, assessing its ability to capture temporal dependencies.
												  Additionally, it explores whether Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) 
												  offer a superior alternative, given their strength in handling non-linear
												   dependencies and long-term patterns. To determine the best approach,
												    both models are benchmarked using key performance metrics such as 
													RMSE and R-squared, providing insights into their predictive accuracy,
													 strengths, and limitations.

												<h3>Lice counts
												</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The figure illustrates the fluctuations in
												 lice counts across various regions of Norway over time,
												  highlighting a notable spike in Vestland during 2012 and 2013.
												   Throughout the observed period, distinct seasonal trends emerge,
												    with lice counts exhibiting annual fluctuations. Despite these
													 variations, the overall trend suggests relative stability, 
													 indicating that while periodic increases and decreases occur,
													  the long-term average remains consistent. The right figure
													   provides further insight by depicting the outbreak count 
													   over time for each region in Norway, offering a broader
													    perspective on the temporal distribution of lice
														 outbreaks across different areas
